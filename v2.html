                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">Cecil John Rhodes had a dream of constructing a railway from Cape to Cairo, but he was unsuccessful. However an even more astounding achievement was by Ewart Scott Grogan, (Born 12-12-1874 London - Died 16-8-1967 Cape Town) an English explorer, politician and entrepreneur who was the first person in recorded history to walk the length of Africa, from Cape Town to Cairo.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">While up at Cambridge, he fell in love with Gertrude Watt, but her stepfather disapproved of the match. He proposed becoming the first man to make the Cape-to-Cairo journey; the stepfather agreed this would be a suitable test of his character and seriousness.</p>
                    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/FBBF24/FFFFFF?text=Grogan's+Route" alt="Cape to Cairo Map" class="w-full rounded-lg my-6 shadow">
                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">During his travels, Grogan had been stalked by lions, hippopotamuses and crocodiles; pursued by head hunters and cannibals; and plagued by parasites and fevers. He returned home a popular sensation. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and met Queen Victoria.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">"I must say I envy you, for you have done that which has been for centuries the ambition of every explorer, namely, to walk through Africa from South to North. The amusement of the whole thing is that a youth from Cambridge during his vacation should have succeeded in doing that which the ponderous explorers of the world have failed to accomplish..."</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">Albie Saayman was instrumental in computerising the Netherlands Bank and headed the computer division of Nedbank [Nedacom]. Former work colleagues recall with affection how Doreen would prepare home cooked meals for the Nedacom staff when they worked double shifts.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">Her secret to her health and amazing age—she only hung up her car keys at the age of 99—is no smoking or drinking, eating healthy food, and her overarching philosophy is to Live to Give and not Live to Receive.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">A strange coincidence as told by Ben Fourie - Accountant in 1974 at Nedbank Kroonstad. Our clients Ditberners Floor Tile Industries imported tiles from Germany. We normally paid the supplier on receipt of the original documents but we never received them and eventually paid on receipt of duplicate documents.</p>

I have kept it since then as it has a rubber stamp "Retrieved from air crash on 20 November 1974 at Nairobi" on the face of it.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">"The accident was caused by the crew initiating a take-off with the leading edge flaps retracted because the pneumatic system which operates them had not been switched on. This resulted in the aircraft becoming airborne in a partially stalled condition which the pilots did not identify in the short time available to them for recovery."</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">In the early 1900s, he used to recount the adventures of his dog 'Jock' (a Staffordshire Bullterrier cross), in the form of bedtime stories to his four children. Rudyard Kipling, an intimate friend, used to take part in these story-telling evenings and it was he who persuaded FitzPatrick to put the stories together in book form.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">The book, which appeared in 1907 for the first time, was an immediate and overwhelming success, being reprinted four times in that year. His name lives on through 'Jock of the Bushveld'.</p>
